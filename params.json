It was later developed by Shafer [3](http://www.glennshafer.com/books/amte.html) into a general framework for uncertainty modeling. In the years, it has been transformed into an important computational tool for evidential reasoning in numerous application scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Computation of Conditionals\r\nThe conditional operation plays an important role in DS theoretic (DST) framework. This library is developed to carrying out computations on Dempster's rule of conditioning and Fagin-Halpern conditioning, the two most widely utilized DST conditional strategies in artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\n",
