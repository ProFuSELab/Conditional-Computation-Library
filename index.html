<p>The Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory, was first introduced by Dempster <a href="http://www.stat.purdue.edu/%7Echuanhai/projects/DS/docs/67Annals.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984504?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">2</a> in the context of statistical inference. It was later developed by Shafer <a href="http://www.glennshafer.com/books/amte.html">3</a> into a general framework for uncertainty modeling. In the years, it has been transformed into an important computational tool for evidential reasoning in numerous application scenarios.</p>

<p>The conditional operation plays an important role in DS theoretic (DST) framework. This library is developed to carrying out computations on Dempster's rule of conditioning and Fagin-Halpern conditioning, the two most widely utilized DST conditional strategies in artificial intelligence.</p>
